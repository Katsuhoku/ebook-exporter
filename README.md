E-book Exporter is a desktop application for exporting digital books in several platforms, like Kindle and Bookwalker, into offline formats (as individual PNG images, or as a PDF), so they can be accessed through other medium.
The application just takes screenshots of the e-book, so the resulting files has no actual selectable text.

##Usage

The interface is pretty simple. In the first text field indicate the number of pages of the book. In the next field, select the desired folder where the resulting images will be saved. Turn on the option below to also generate a PDF.

Before starting, open the desired e-book your browser. If you have multiple screens (multiple desktops), put the browser window in the main screen. For better results, make the browser fullscreen. Then put the application window to the left or right of the screen (the e-book has to be visible in the center of the screen), and press Start Capture.

While the capture is active, do not move the cursor or click on the screen, as it may affect the capture process and produce unwanted results. The button "Start Capture" is green when it's ready for capture, and it tursn red when it's capturing.
